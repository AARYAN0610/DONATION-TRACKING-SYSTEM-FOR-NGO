# DONATION-TRACKING-SYSTEM-FOR-NGO
A donation tracking system lets an NGO record and verify every contribution in one place—who gave, how much, when, and where it was used. It cuts out messy spreadsheets, prevents missing funds, and makes audits and reporting straightforward. Without it, an NGO is guessing and hoping; with it transparency and accountability are provable not assumed.
